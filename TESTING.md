## Code Validation

I have validated all the code files in my hotel booking project using industry-standard validators. This ensures that my code follows best practices and maintains high quality standards. The validation was performed on the deployed site to catch any potential issues that might arise in production.

### HTML

I have used the [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all HTML templates. This ensures proper HTML structure and helps identify any potential rendering issues across different browsers.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted comprehensive automated tests on the application using Django's built-in unit testing framework. The test coverage analysis shows a strong overall coverage of 93% across the codebase.

### Test Execution

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
python manage.py test name-of-app
```

### Coverage Analysis

To generate and view test coverage reports:

1. Install coverage:
```bash
pip install coverage
```

2. Generate requirements:
```bash
pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

3. Run coverage analysis:
```bash
coverage run --omit=*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py manage.py test
coverage report
```

4. For detailed HTML reports:
```bash
coverage html
python -m http.server
```

## Bugs

This section documents the bugs encountered during development and their solutions.

### Django and Python Bugs

1. **Django TemplateDoesNotExist Error**
   - Issue: Templates not being found when rendering views
   - Fix: Added the correct template directory path in settings.py:
   ```python
   TEMPLATES = [
       {
           'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
           'APP_DIRS': True,
           ...
       }
   ]
   ```

2. **Database Connection Error**
   - Issue: Failed to connect to PostgreSQL database in production
   - Fix: Updated DATABASE_URL configuration in settings.py to use dj_database_url:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
   }
   ```

3. **Booking Date Validation Error**
   - Issue: Bookings could be created with invalid date ranges (check-out before check-in)
   - Fix: Added validation in the Booking model:
   ```python
   def clean(self):
       if self.check_out <= self.check_in:
           raise ValidationError("Check-out date must be after check-in date")
   ```

4. **Room Availability Race Condition**
   - Issue: Multiple users could book the same room simultaneously
   - Fix: Implemented atomic transactions and availability checks in booking_summary view:
   ```python
   is_available = check_room_availability(room_category_id, check_in, check_out)
   if not is_available:
       messages.error(request, "No available rooms in this category for the selected date range.")
   ```

5. **Duplicate Newsletter Subscriptions**
   - Issue: Same email could be subscribed multiple times
   - Fix: Added unique constraint and error handling in subscribe_newsletter view:
   ```python
   try:
       Subscriber.objects.create(email=email)
   except:
       messages.info(request, 'You are already subscribed to our newsletter!')
   ```

### Frontend Bugs

1. **Form Validation Display**
   - Issue: Form validation errors not showing properly in templates
   - Fix: Added proper error handling in templates:
   ```html
   <input type="text" class="form-control {% if form.field.errors %}is-invalid{% endif %}">
   {% if form.field.errors %}
       <div class="invalid-feedback">
           {{ form.field.errors.0 }}
       </div>
   {% endif %}
   ```

2. **Date Picker Timezone Issues**
   - Issue: Check-in/check-out times not handling timezone correctly
   - Fix: Added timezone handling in views:
   ```python
   naive_datetime = datetime.strptime(check_in_datetime, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M')
   booking.actual_check_in = timezone.make_aware(naive_datetime)
   ```

3. **Profile Access Control**
   - Issue: Users could access other users' profiles
   - Fix: Added proper authorization check in view_profile:
   ```python
   if not request.user.is_authenticated or (request.user != profile_user and not request.user.is_staff):
       messages.warning(request, "You are not authorized to view this profile.")
       return redirect('mainsite:home')
   ```
