## UX

The design of the hotel booking system focuses on creating a luxurious and user-friendly experience. The interface is clean, modern, and intuitive, making it easy for users to browse rooms, make bookings, and manage their reservations.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme was carefully chosen to reflect a premium hotel experience while maintaining excellent readability and user experience:

- `#f8f9fa` used for background colors, creating a clean and spacious feel
- `#ffc107` used for primary highlights and hover effects
- `#0d6efd` used for interactive elements and icons
- `#444` used for secondary text
- `#ffffff` used for cards and content blocks

The color palette was designed to:
- Create a sense of luxury and comfort
- Ensure high contrast for readability
- Maintain consistency across all pages
- Provide clear visual feedback for interactive elements

### Typography

The website uses a combination of modern, clean fonts to enhance readability and create a premium feel:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) is used for headings and important text elements, providing a strong and elegant presence
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) is used for body text, ensuring excellent readability across all devices
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons are used throughout the site for visual elements like:
  - Navigation items
  - Room amenities
  - Contact information
  - Booking status indicators
  - Payment methods

The typography system is designed to:
- Create clear visual hierarchy
- Ensure readability across all screen sizes
- Maintain consistency throughout the user journey
- Support the premium feel of the hotel brand

### Auto-generating ERD with pygraphviz

I used `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD. Here are the steps I followed:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config
   pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz
   ```

2. Add 'django_extensions' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'django_extensions',
       ...
   ]
   ```

3. Generate the ERD:
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png
   ```

4. Move the generated `erd.png` to your documentation folder

5. Clean up:
   ```bash
   pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y
   ```

The generated ERD can be found in the documentation folder:

## Agile Development Process

### Project Management Tools

#### GitHub Projects
[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/chrysanthusobinna/django-hotel/projects) served as our primary Agile tool for project management. Through careful organization of tags and project creation, we effectively utilized the Kanban board to track user stories, issues, and milestone tasks on a weekly basis.

![GitHub Projects Board](documentation/gh-projects.png)

#### GitHub Issues
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chrysanthusobinna/django-hotel/issues) complemented our Agile workflow with a custom **User Story Template** for managing user stories and tracking milestone iterations.

- **Open Issues** [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/chrysanthusobinna/django-hotel)](https://github.com/chrysanthusobinna/django-hotel/issues)  
  ![Open Issues](documentation/gh-issues-open.png)

- **Closed Issues** [![GitHub closed issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/chrysanthusobinna/django-hotel)](https://github.com/chrysanthusobinna/django-hotel/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)  
  ![Closed Issues](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)


### Prioritization Methodology

I implemented the MoSCoW prioritization technique to effectively manage our backlog:

- **Must Have**: Critical features guaranteed for delivery (max 60% of stories)
- **Should Have**: Important features that add significant value (approximately 20% of stories)
- **Could Have**: Desirable features with smaller impact (approximately 20% of stories)
- **Won't Have**: Features deferred to future iterations

This approach allowed me to decompose Epics into manageable stories, apply appropriate prioritization labels, and maintain focus on delivering the most valuable features first.

## Ecommerce Business Model

This hotel booking system follows a `Business to Customer` (B2C) model, focusing on providing a seamless booking experience for individual guests. The platform is designed to:

- Enable direct room bookings by individual customers
- Provide transparent pricing and room availability
- Offer secure payment processing
- Allow customers to manage their bookings and profiles
- Support customer communication through social media

The system includes features for:
- Room browsing and filtering
- Real-time availability checking
- Secure payment processing
- Booking management
- Customer profile management

Social media integration helps build a community of guests and promotes the hotel's brand, while the newsletter system enables direct communication about:
- Special offers and seasonal promotions
- New room types or amenities
- Event announcements
- Seasonal packages
- Important updates about hotel services

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### SEO Implementation

The project implements comprehensive SEO best practices:

1. **Meta Tags & Open Graph**
   - Custom meta descriptions and keywords for each page
   - Open Graph tags for better social media sharing
   - Responsive viewport settings
   - Proper title tags with dynamic content

2. **Technical SEO**
   - XML Sitemap implementation (sitemap.xml)
   - Robots.txt configuration with proper directives
   - Clean URL structure
   - Mobile-responsive design

3. **Keywords Strategy**
   The site targets relevant hotel and booking-related keywords:
   - Primary: hotel, booking, rooms, accommodation
   - Secondary: luxury stay, comfortable rooms, hotel reservation
   - Location-based keywords for better local SEO

### Sitemap Implementation

The project uses a comprehensive XML sitemap that includes:
- Homepage (priority: 1.00)
- About page (priority: 0.80)
- Contact page (priority: 0.80)
- Room listing pages
- Other important site sections

The sitemap is properly referenced in the robots.txt file and follows XML sitemap protocol standards.

### Robots.txt Configuration

The robots.txt file is configured with:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /accounts/
Sitemap: https://santhus-hotel-d0ffe8e23f1e.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

This configuration:
- Allows search engines to crawl all public pages
- Restricts access to account-related pages for security
- Properly references the sitemap location

### Social Media Integration

The site implements Open Graph meta tags for optimal social media sharing:
- Dynamic title and description for each page
